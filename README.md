# MegaBytesConverter

Hello everyone!

I've recently decided to move forward after learning the basics of Web Development and started learning Java.

This is my first tiny project in this prgramming language. Using this programm you can easily convert kilobytes in megabytes and remaining kilobytes.
For calculating remaining kilobytes I've used the remainder operator in the separate method.


Have fun!
